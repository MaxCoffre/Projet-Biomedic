The dataset was exported from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilimadeddinehosni/multi-resistance-antibiotic-susceptibility

The data are virtual and based on statistics.

The problematic is to quantify the impact of risk factor on the resistance ratio of bacteria to 15 antibiotics.

The risks factors are : diabetes, hypertension, previous hospitalisation and infection frequency.

We calculate a resistance ratio for each bacterium and we use ttests to evaluate the significance of the impact of risks factors.

Some other data were added, like climate data in USA (those are real).
